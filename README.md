# Introduction to Econometrics (Fall 2022)
This repository contains the TA notes and recitation slides I have used for the 2022 Fall semester. It includes the TeX files for the lecture notes and recitation slides used in Fall 2021 semester. Please contact me (sl4436@columbia.edu) or send a pull request if you spot any errors.

## What is different compared to previous semesters?
There is stronger emphasis on causal inference, as evidenced by the amount of notes discussing the randomized control trial framework and interpretation of the estimators based on causality. There are more explicit discussion of various treatment effects (average treatment effect, average treatment effect based on observables, local average treatment effect) and how different estimation methods can be used to derive these interpretations. With that said, the contents do still address key properties of estimators as I have in the past. 

### Book (To be released soon)
This folder contains one TeX file that compiles all topics covered in Introduction to Econometrics class in Columbia University. It combines the materials used in Fall 2019, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Fall 2022 semesters. This version supercedes the previous versions with the same name. 

### Recitations
Each recitation folder contains a recitation note (roughly 10 pages each) and a recitation slide (used in actual recitation sessions) for the following topics listed below. For certain recitations, a STATA code used for in-class demonstrations is included.
